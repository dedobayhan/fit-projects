Client/server file transfer

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple file transfer program, similar to the ftp. You can download files from
the server, upload files to the server, delete files from the server and
get file lists from the server. For detailed information about used
protocol see 'protocol.pdf'.

This program consists of two separate programs - client and server.
Once you have started the server you will be able to perform varius
transfer operations by client program (see descriptions).

Both programs don't read anything from the standard input and print information
to the standard output. Error messages are printed to the standard error.

Compilation and usage:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile both programs simply run `make` or `./test.sh`, respectively,
which will also run some basic tests (examples of usage).
There are two preview directories - '_client' and '_server',
from which you can try this program yourself by running `./server`
and/or `./client` (after compilation). There are also some testing files.

Server program description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:
    server
Synopsis:
    server port
Description:
	Starts concurrent file server from which are clients available
	to download and/or upload files, delete files and get file lists.

	If some error appears during server startup, server will be shut down
	and error message will be shown. If there is an error during service,
	only error message will be shown, but server will continue working.

	You can shut down the server manually by sending SIGTERM or SIGKILL signal
	to the server process. Another signals will be blocked or ignored.

	port  Port on which the server will be listening (1024-65535)
Example:
    server 10000
      Starts server listening on the port 10000.

Client program description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:
    client
Synopsis:
    client -h hostname -p port [-d|u|e|l] file_name
Description:
    Uploads/downloads/deletes selected file to/from the selected server
    or gets file list.

    -h  Server's hostname
    -p  Port on which the server is listening (1024-65535)
    -d  Downloads selected file from the server
    -u  Uploads selected file to the server
    -e  Deletes selected file from the server
    -l  Prints files that are currently on the server (set file_name
        to . for all files or to file_name when interested only
        if this particular file is on the server)
Example:
    client -h eva.fit.vutbr.cz -p 10000 -u test.txt
      Uploads file test.txt from the current client's directory
      to the actual server's working directory.

Restrictions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- file name (in download/list mode) must be without absolute or relative path
- you can only download/list files that are in the current server's working
  directory (again without absolute or relative path)
- transmission doesn't preserve file permissions
- you can't download/upload/delete directories
- you can't download/upload/delete files named "server"
- there is no way how to shut down the server but sending
  SIGTERM or SIGKILL signal to the server process
