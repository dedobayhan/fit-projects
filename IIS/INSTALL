                               Installation and requirements

Server requirements:
    Web server - any
    PHP5 - version: >= 5.2
         - enabled modules: mysql, libxml, simplexml, mbstring, session
         - enabled configuration: file_uploads on
    MySQL - version: >= 4.0.27 (recommended version: >= 5.0)
          - access to a database (utf8 character set)
          - account with (at least) the following privileges:
              DROP, CREATE, INDEX, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, SHOW

Client requirements:
 - web browser with enabled cookies and javascript

Installation:
 - copy all the files and directories (excluding README, INSTALL and doc.html)
   into some directory, which is accessible from the Internet via web browser
   and handled by the web server (php scripts execution), e.g. ~/WWW/IIS/
 - be sure that you have right permissions on that directory (so the
   web content can be publicly viewable), e.g. "drwxr-xr-x"
 - the following directories must be publicly writeable (drwxrwxrwx)
    - ./logs
    - ./web/templates/cache
    - ./web/templates/templates_c
 - edit the configuration file (./web/config.php) and set everything under
     "// Database configuration", e.g.:
     $db_host = 'localhost';     // MySQL server
     $db_name = 'iis';           // Name of the database
     $db_user = 'username';      // Username
     $db_pass = 'password';      // Password
     $db_table_prefix = 'iis_';  // Prefix of all tables - it is recommended
                                    to keep this value, if you change it you
                                    will have to change it also in the database
                                    script (./sql/database.sql)
 - load all the database tables and data by running:
      mysql -p database_name < ./sql/database.sql
 - that's all - now you can try to connect to the application via your
   favorite web browser (e.g.: http://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz/~xlogin00/IIS)
 - if you encounter some problem, please let me know: xzemek02@stud.fit.vutbr.cz
