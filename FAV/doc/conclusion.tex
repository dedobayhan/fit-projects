\section*{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have tested and examined the Spin model checker. The principles of the tool were studied, two demonstration examples were implemented and used for experiments. An own synchronization problem was proposed and solved with the solution being verified to be correct (wrt. given properties) by Spin. Source codes of the tool were examined in order to get better knowledge of how it works.
