                Petr Zemek, xzemek02@stud.fit.vutbr.cz, 2008

Description:
  Script converts passed HTML page (specififed by its URL, local file or data
  from standard input) with publications in a standard format into
  BibTeXML (resulting XML is printed on standard output).

Requirements:
  - python >= 2.5.1 (http://www.python.org/)

Usage:
  ./xzemek02 [SOURCE...]

  SOURCE can be either page URL, local file or (if omitted) standard input.
  If more sources are given, resulting XML will be a union of all publications
  from all the sources.

Extra features:
 - script can convert standard LaTeX *.bib files into BibTeXML (however,
   all keys will be changed if present)
 - script can convert also plain texts with publications (blank line
   is considered a delimiter between two publications) into BibTeXML
