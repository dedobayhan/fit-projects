Description:
  Demonstration program on conversion from regular expressions to finite
  automata. You can input some regular expression and the program will generate
  automata for each of that regular expression part (for example, if you enter
  "a+b", then you will see an automaton which accepts "a", then an automaton
  which accepts "b" and then a union of these two automata).

Requirements:
 - python >= 2.5 (http://www.python.org/)
 - wxPython >= 2.8 (http://www.wxpython.org/)
 - graphviz >= 2.20 (http://www.graphviz.org/)

Installation:
  No special procedure is required, just unpack all files from the archive
  to some directory.

Usage:
  Just run `python vype.py` and the main application window will popup. Then,
  enter some regular expression to the input field on the upper left side of
  the window and press "Process RegExp". By pressing "Previous step" and "Next
  step", you can iterate over all of the created automata for each part of the
  regular expression.
