Ondřej Lengál's specialization was the temporal part of the project, database
connection including queries execution and special queries creation.
Libor Polčák populated our database with basic data (like pavilions and animals),
considered animal management and created popup menus providing variable
operations with objects in our application.
Boris Procházka took care of the graphical user interface related to the drawing
of objects (different view modes, zoom) and manipulation with them (moving
animals, creating new objects etc).

(uploading images, searching by image similarity and description) and
team work management.
