                        PDS - Serial-TCP/IP bridge, 2009
                       ----------------------------------

Description:
    Simple serial-TCP/IP bridge. This program starts a concurrent TCP/IP server
    and accepts client connections. When some client sends a message to
    the server, it redirects it to the serial port. When there is an incoming
    message on the serial port, it resends that message to all connected clients.

Extensions and restrictions:
    - some configuration options have restricted set of possible values
      (e.g. you cannot set 1.5 stop bits, because there seems to be no way
       how to set 1.5 stop bits on Linux; length_field can be maximally 4;
       see bridge.cfg for other restrictions)
    - connection timeout is reseted not only when a message is received,
      but also if a message is sent (to allow large data transfers)

System requirements:
    - GNU Linux, x86/x86_64, kernel >= 2.6

Software needed to compile and run the serial-TCP/IP bridge:
    Name                        Version   Purpose
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    GNU make                     >= 3.8   Compilation and linking of the project
    g++                          >= 4.2   C++ source files compiler and linker
    Standard C and C++ lib (with STL)     Functions, types

Optional software:
    Name                        Version   Purpose
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    CPPUnit                      >= 1.12  Unit testing framework to compile
                                          the testing suite
Compilation:
    - simply run `make` command in the project root directory
    - to compile the project tester, run `make test` instead

Bridge startup (synopsis):
    ./bridge -f CONF_FILE_PATH

    CONF_FILE_PATH - path to the configuration file (e.g. bridge.cfg)

Usage examples:
    ./bridge -f ./bridge.cfg

Project was tested on:
    - Debian 5.0, 2.6.28, x86_64
    - Kubuntu 8.04, 2.6.24, x86_32
    - CentOS 5, 2.6.16, x86_64
    - Fedora 10, 2.6.27, x86_32
